# Imp-Portfolio
Improvements on past projects

1) imp-clock
This improved clock has a more science fiction-esque color scheme and I also updated the code so that the minute and second hands rotate clockwise in synchronization with the framerate of the sketch divided by 50 so that it moves more fluidly and slow enough for the counts to be readable. Furthermore, four stars have been added using the ellipse function.

2) imp-bot
This improved twitter bot has a greater number of permutations. The original bot allowed approximately 118,000 unique tweets. The new bot allows approximately 122,000, which stems from 7 new lines of code.
