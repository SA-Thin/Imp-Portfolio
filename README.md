# Imp-Portfolio
Improvements on past projects

1) imp-clock
This improved clock has a more science fiction-esque color scheme and I also updated the code so that the minute and second hands rotate clockwise in synchronization with the framerate of the sketch divided by 50 so that it moves more fluidly and slow enough for the counts to be readable. Furthermore, four stars have been added using the ellipse function.

2) imp-bot
This improved twitter bot has a greater number of permutations. The original bot allowed approximately 118,000 unique tweets. The new bot allows approximately 122,000, which stems from 7 new lines of code.

3) imp-novel
This improved novel-writing program takes additional text from selected excerpts from Divergent, Handmaid's Tale, and Hunger Games to make new sentences and parse into the previous text file containing new sentences formed from Orwell's 1984 mixed with excerpts from Card's Ender's Game. Furthermore, spacing rng values have been adjusted and the function iterates 3800 times instead of 3600, producing a novel that is twice as long on average.

4) imp-pixel
This version of pixelsort-master has different arguments and parameters so that the the images come out with different adjustments than the default.

Reflection:
When I tackled this portfolio project, I asked myself what projects had the most potential for a drastic change in output.
When revising the projects, I first decided what exactly I wanted the new, improved final product to be, then determined what modifications would make that end goal possible. For the clock, I believe the new product is more streamlined and pleasing to look at. For the Twitter bot, it will now make even more, hilariously bad advice for college. The bot is known enough on its hashtag that there are regular likers/retweeters for its tweets. The newer novel program has a larger word pool to choose from and also produces a longer transcript for those that like to read. Finally, I adjusted the arguments and parameters on the pixelsort program because the default settings weren't making noticeable changes to many of the pictures I originally tried.

Final Grade rationale:
I believe I deserve a 90% in the class because I completed all the assignments and also helped classmates Jazz, Matthew, Kyle, and Megan outside of class on several of their own projects. Although my tight schedule and inconvenient class locations hindered me from getting to class on time, I put in effort whenever I was in the class and also kept up with content outside of class.
